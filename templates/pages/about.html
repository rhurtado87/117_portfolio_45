        <h2>Ricardo Hurtado</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ricardo, a passionate individual with a love for coding and technology. Fresh out of school, I have developed a solid foundation in both frontend and backend development. My expertise lies primarily in backend development, with proficiency in Python using frameworks like Django and Flask. I am skilled in using Git for version control, including branching and merging, and enjoy collaborating with other developers on projects.

        <p>
        I possess a robust skill set that enables me to build complete web applications from conception to deployment. I thrive on solving problems and am dedicated to delivering high-quality, scalable solutions. I am eager to leverage my skills and continue learning to contribute effectively to innovative tech projects.
